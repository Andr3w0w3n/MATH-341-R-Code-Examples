Problem (1)

I created two arrays with values 1 through 6. I then sampled from both of the arrays
(3 times for the three roll die and 5 times for the five roll die) wihtout replacement 
as these are die and it would not make sense for there to be replacement. I added the 
sum of those samples (as the problem required i know them). Then I compared the sum to 
see if the sums met the requirements. If the sums did meet the requirement, then I would 
count it into the total array. At the end, take the average of the total array to see the
probability value.

#roll three 6-sided dice and find the sum of the dice
#roll five 6-side dice and find the sum
#find the probability of the 3 die sum being as large 
#or larger than the 5 die sum
nsim = 100000
cat(nsim)
threeDie = 1:6
fiveDie = 1:6
for(j in 1:10){
  rolls = rep(0, nsim)
  for(i in 1:nsim){
    threeRoll = sample(threeDie, 3, replace = T)
    fiveRoll = sample(fiveDie, 5, replace = T)
    threeSum = sum(threeRoll)
    fiveSum = sum(fiveRoll)
    if(threeSum >= fiveSum){
      rolls[i] = 1
    }
  }
  cat("the mean is: ", mean(rolls), "\n")
}

Results:
the mean is:  0.09189 
the mean is:  0.09139 
the mean is:  0.09109 
the mean is:  0.092 
the mean is:  0.09131 
the mean is:  0.09174 
the mean is:  0.08987 
the mean is:  0.0908 
the mean is:  0.09099 
the mean is:  0.09066 

Conclusion: The probability is about 0.091 or 9.1%


Problem(2)

I created a deck array that holds 52 cards. I then sampled this array for cards valued 13 or 
less as there are 13 heart cards. There was no replacement because the problem asked for no
replacement of the cards when choosen. I then checked to see if one and only one of the samples
was 13 or lower. If the cards met the reuirements, it was recorded in the simulation array. At the 
end, the simulation array was averaged out to get the probability. The extra loop is simply for more 
than one of these tests, to make sure nothing went wrong and to get a more accurate average if I
needed it.

#select two cards for deck without replacement
#find the probability of selecting exactly one heart

nsim = 100000
deck = 1:52
drawOneHeart = FALSE
for(j in 1:10){
  exactlyOne = rep(0,nsim)
  for(i in 1:nsim){
    samp = sample(deck, 2, replace = F)
    if((samp[1] <= 13 && samp[2] <= 13)|| (samp[1]>13 && samp[2] >13)){
      drawOneHeart = FALSE
    }
    else if((samp[1] <= 13 && samp[2] >13)|| (samp[1] > 13 && samp[2] <= 13)){
      drawOneHeart = TRUE
    }
    if(drawOneHeart){
      exactlyOne[i] = 1
    }
  }
  cat("the mean is: ", mean(exactlyOne), "\n")
}

Results: 
the mean is:  0.38336 
the mean is:  0.38223 
the mean is:  0.38165 
the mean is:  0.38036 
the mean is:  0.38407 
the mean is:  0.38215 
the mean is:  0.38367 
the mean is:  0.38339 
the mean is:  0.38216 
the mean is:  0.37927 

Conclusion: The probability is about 0.38 or 38%


Problem (3)

This problem was very similar to problem number two. This time, I was not only checking for hearts
but also for kings. I assumed the number 13 in my deck array was the king of hearts. I used 49-52
as my remaining kings, with all numbers 1-12 as hearts. Then, like problem two, I checked to see
if the sample landed in the requirements. If It did, then i would be conunted in the simulation
array. At the end (as with the other problems) I averaged out the amount of times that the requirements
were met to get the probability.

#pick two cards without replacement
#exactly one heart and exactly one king

nsim = 100000
deck = 1:52
drawHaK = FALSE
for(j in 1:10){
  exactlyOne = rep(0,nsim)
  for(i in 1:nsim){
    samp = sample(deck, 2, replace = F)
    if((samp[1] < 13 & samp[2] > 49) | (samp[1] > 49 & samp[2] < 13) | (samp[1] == 13 & samp[2]%in%14:49) | (samp[1]%in%14:49 & samp[2]==13)){
      drawHaK = TRUE
    }
    else{
      drawHaK = FALSE
    }
    if(drawHaK){
      exactlyOne[i] = 1
    }
  }
  cat("the mean is: ", mean(exactlyOne), "\n")
}

Results:
the mean is:  0.0532 
the mean is:  0.05412 
the mean is:  0.05285 
the mean is:  0.05599 
the mean is:  0.05408 
the mean is:  0.055 
the mean is:  0.05556 
the mean is:  0.05589 
the mean is:  0.05394 
the mean is:  0.05495 

Conclusion: The probability is about 0.054 or 5.4%
